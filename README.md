# runs-on/action

RunsOn Action for magic caching, and more. This action is required if you are using the magic caching feature of [RunsOn](https://runs-on.com) (`extras=s3-cache` job label).

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: runs-on=${{ github.run_id }}/runner=2cpu-linux-x64/extras=s3-cache
    steps:
      - uses: runs-on/action@v1
      - other steps
```

## Options

- `show-env`: Show all environment variables available to actions (used for debugging purposes).

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: runs-on=${{ github.run_id }}/runner=2cpu-linux-x64/extras=s3-cache
    steps:
      - uses: runs-on/action@v1
        with:
          show-env: true
```

## Future work

This action will probably host a few other features such as:

- enabling instance monitoring through CloudWatch (RAM, CPU, etc.)
- enabling/disabling SSM agent ?
